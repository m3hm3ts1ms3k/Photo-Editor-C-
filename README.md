My goal was to make it easy for users to have features such as photo editing, cropping, applying effects, changing extensions and paint mode in one application.

With this application, you can apply 

- Sepia
- Grayscale
- Invert colors
- Brightness
- Contrast
- Saturation
- Paint mode
- Resize
- Change extension
- Mirror image
- Rotation 
- Zoom 

effects and features to your photo and save your photo.

Images and icons I used in the project = https://www.iconfinder.com

Anyone who is interested in C# language and wants to learn photo manipulation can use this application comfortably.
